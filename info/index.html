<h1>Ancient Greece</h1>
<h3>Who were the ancient Greeks?</h3>
<body> <br />
<p>
    About 2,500 years ago, Greece was one of the most important places in the ancient world. <br>
    The Greeks were great thinkers, warriors, writers, actors, athletes, artists, architects and <br>
    politicians. The Greeks called themselves Hellenes and their land was Hellas. The name <br>
    ‘Greeks’ was given to the people of Greece later by the Romans. They lived in mainland<br>
    Greece and the Greek islands, but also in colonies scattered around the Mediterranean Sea. <br>
    There were Greeks in Italy, Sicily, Turkey, North Africa, and as far west as France. They<br>
    sailed the sea to trade and find new lands. The Greeks took their ideas with them and they<br>
    started a way of life that's similar to the one we have today.</p>
